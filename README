Chromnitweet is a Google Chrome (or Chromium) extension that acts as a Twitter
client, allowing the user to post tweet (status update or direct message)
directly from the Omnibox (Omnibar, awesome bar, URL bar, location bar, etc.)
with the syntax "tw [some string of 140 or less characters]".

Useless fact: Chromnitweet is a portmanteau of Chrome, Omnibox and Tweet.

INSTALLATION

The build system depends on GNU make, Zip, Java and the Closure compiler[1]. You
probably need to be on Linux or Mac to use the Makefile as is. The compiler
should be at $HOME/bin/compiler.jar but you can specify a new location by
running:

        make JSC='java -jar /path/to/compiler.jar'

Or just edit the Makefile.
